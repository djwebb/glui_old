This contains 'simple1' which is my branch of the original GLUI User Interface Library.  
It is now only of historical interest because the original GLUI repository has now been relaced.

simple_1 includes changes to correct the behaviour of and improve the FileBrowser.
It includes:
(a)  Correction to double-click arithmetic on gnu linux systems.
(b)  Filtering of filenames in filename list (gnu linux).
(c)  Ordering of directories and filenames in list (gnu linux).
(d)  Reset first line of displayed filelist when changing directories.
(e)  Changed (improved?) code to remove many gnu g++ warnings.
